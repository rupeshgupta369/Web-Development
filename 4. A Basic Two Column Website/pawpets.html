                <h2>1. Because you'll save a life.</h2>
                <p>Each year, it's estimated that more than one million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in India, simply because too many pets come into shelters and too few people consider adoption when looking for a pet.</p>
                <p>The number of euthanized animals could be reduced dramatically if more people adopted pets instead of buying them. When you adopt, you save a loving animal by making them part of your family and open up shelter space for another animal who might desperately need it.</p>

                <br>
                <h2>2. Because you'll get a great animal.</h2>  
                <p>Animal shelters and rescue groups are brimming with happy, healthy pets just waiting for someone to take them home. Most shelter pets wound up there because of a human problem like a move or a divorce, not because the animals did anything wrong. Many are already house-trained and used to living with families.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>3. Because adoption helps more than just one animal.</h2>
                <p>Overburdened shelters take in millions of stray, abused and lost animals every year, and by adopting an animal, you’re making room for others. Not only are you giving more animals a second chance, but the cost of your adoption goes directly towards helping those shelters better care for the animals they take in!</p>
                <br>   
                <h2>4. Because your home will thank you.</h2>
                <p>Many of the pets from shelters and rescues are already house-trained, which means you’re not only saving a pet’s life, you may be saving your rug. Adopting a mature pet not only gives older animals a second chance, it often means introducing them to your family will be much easier.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>5. Because you'll change a homeless animal's whole world.</h2>
                <p>And get a new best friend out of the deal. Seriously, what could be better than that?</p>
